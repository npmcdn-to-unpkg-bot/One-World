##### Created by [Serena Stater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serena-stater-912115111) and [Timothy Ingram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-ingram-40366852)

### The Problem

According to the United Nations, there are currently 20 million refugees worldwide. Over half of these people are under the age of 18. Many of them are living in unsafe conditions in camps or on the streets.

### The Solution

ONE World aims to help solve this problem and to povide relief to governments and NGOs whose resources are stretched far too thin.

ONE World consists of a network of hosts who are willing to take refugee families into their homes, on a temporary basis, while they wait for permanent placement. Think "Airbnb" for refugees.

#### User Story 1:

> As a host, I would like to provide shelter to refugees in need so that families don't have to live in unsafe conditions.

#### User Story 2:

> As a refugee, I would like to find safe housing so that my family has a stable home environment.
